TO DO:
- Add line search methods for non-convex problems (binary decreasing eta from 1)
- For CRF factors, change the regularization_penalty() method to be
  regularization() (adding instead of subtracting the regularization)?
- Make optimization and learning classes' parameter structs include methods
  for adding and parsing command-line options, and then use these to
  consolidate code in tests like fmri_test_real.cpp.
- Add vector_record_iterator (just as in finite_record).
- Figure out why crf_parameter_leaner_test, when given a fixed random seed,
  seems to generate the same model in different tests but gives different
  train/test log likelihoods for the true model.
