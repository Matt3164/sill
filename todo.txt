0. more unit tests
1. move to Armadillo's sparse matrices 
2. move to C++11
3. drop dependence on Boost for the main template library (keep it for Python bindings and tests)
4. remove much of the custom code like forward_range, range-based algorithms, operator std::string
5. move domain, assignment, etc. to separate data structures
6. variable values, not pointers
7. general code cleanup
   - simplify design wherever possible
   - parallel-friendly
   - performance (speed + memory) - 
   - facebook formatting guidelines wrt the newline after ( +
   - trailing underscore for member vars
   - allow edge creation outside of the graph
   - rename random_table_factor_functor to table_factor_generator
   - change the function signatures from generate_xxx to operator()
     so that the generator can be used directly e.g in loopy bp 
     without adapters
